<h1><strong>Lindsey's Personal Portfolio Website Comparison</strong></h1>
	
<h2><strong><em>Question 1: Which two websites are you most inspired by? How to they effectively communicate size, space and balance?</strong></em></h2>

		<p>Of all the websites I explored for this project, I ended up choosing two artist/designer portfolio style projects from <a href=
		http://www.thomasduval.com>Thomas Duval</a> and <a href=http://nilas-ka.com>Nilas K. Anderson</a>.<br> The moment Thomas Duval's website opened, I was greated by a single rectangular photograph of a black lobster, placed in the center of the screen as a primary focal point, against an even darker black negatives space. Across the center of the image in white capital lettering is a heading that boldy states "THOMAS DUVAL" (in 18pt font). Centered below it in smaller white capitals "Photographer" is written (in 12pt font). (Please note, this image changes on every subseqent opening of the site but the lettering and placement of the title remain the same).This brief and unexpected introduction sets the tone for the next screen, the index page of the site. This introductory site page again states "THOMAS DUVAL", but this time it is centerd in black capital lettering against white negatives space.</p>
		<p>In the same headline, written on the same line as Thomas Duval's name, are two links, one for "About" and one for "Contact". Both words are in all capital lettering in approximately 8pt font, but colored so as not to pull focus from the page, in de-emphasized, faded gray lettering. The heading has been generously padded with about 2" of space, approximatel 1" above and 1" below Mr. Duval's name. Directly below are two photographs, padded with equal negative space on the right and left borders of the screen, creating a sense of visual balance. The left image is a large black rectangle, long side down, that appears to have a very dark mountain image set into it and a caption, written in the same coloring as the "About" and Contact" links from the headline, stating "Black Landscape". Next to this image, in direct contrast to it's dark color, is a smaller rectangle, about 1/3 its size, short side down, with a bright green plant that has been tied with string, set against a bright white background. The caption below this image reads: "Bondage Vegetal". Both images are held by enough white space (negative space) to make them the immediate focal point, first to the dark image then to the light one, in a sense obeying the way we read, from left to right.<br></p>
		<p>In trying to establish the hierarchy and flow, I notice that there are no obvious navigational arrows or cues (no scroll bar at the right), to inform my movement. However, the lack of navigation encourages users to explore either the About, Contact or image links, depending what their end goal is for searching the site. In this case, I found myself automatically scrolling down below the fold and was immediately rewarded with a wealth of additional images, all sharing the dark/light contrast, all rectangular photographs of different sizes, some short side down, some long side down, but all held within a feeling of beautiful balance, aided by the carefully chosen negatives spaces surrounding them. I appreciate that, to facilitate the sense of a balance among the mismatched shapes, the designer opted to leave the same amount of space between each set of images. I also noted as my cursor moved down the page that several of the images changed immediately to another image, which kept changing as I rolled over the picture, following the themes stated below each rectangle, in the same faded gray 8pt font as the About and Contact buttons. I allowed myself to click on one set, entitled "White", and a new page opened, this time with a rectangular photograph that filled the entire screen, less 1" at the bottom, with "THOMAS DUVAL" written in the same font size, color and with the same central placement as on the site's index page. For the first time a square black box with a white dotted "X" in the middle, appears in the top right corner of the screen, a navigational cue to close the page selected. Before closing, I scroll down below the fold and am greeted with an explanation of the photoset I have chosen, the title centered on the page, written in black 18pt bold, capital letters, the paragraph text also centered but written in the 8pt faded gray lettering of the previous page. To add a sense of more defined balance, Mr. Duval uses a column style placement, with the photographs paired in rectangular form, short side down, in groups of two. Each pairing has the same amount of white space between the images themselves and the sets, as well as equal padding of negative space on the left and right borders. This layout keeps any one image from overpowering another. It also creats a sense of order and visual balance to images that quite often otherwise have none. When the final image pairing is over, there is a link, centered across the bottom and written in 8pt faded gray font, that takes viewers back to the index page of the site. Every set of images from the site's main page opens with this same lettering and format as the "White" set, creating a natural flow to the site and imparting the sense of literally and seemlessly being connected to all the different sets at once. It also helped that none of the images had dates on them, so there was no sense of moving through time or being disjointed with it. I was completely free to explore and appreciate the artwork and the site's construction.</p>
		<p>The second portfolio site I studied belongs to Nilas K. Andersen. When I opened his website, there was no preview page to establish the site's tone, as there had been for Thomas Duval's site, however, the coloring of the site was quite similar. Both used black lettering against a white negative space. Mr. Andersen's headline contained his name and professional abiity (Graphic Design and Photography), set against the far left border of the page. On the right border, centered but sideways, is the contact information, something that requires the viewer to tilt their head sideways to read. I immediately knew from this visual cue that the site was encouraging me to explore. Before doing so, I noted there is a solid visual balance to this index page, albeit the sidways lettering is not completely conventional. I turned my attention to the page's focal point: a series of what seem to be cut-up slices of different images that have been married together to form a rectangle (the same image shape used on the other site). As I moved the cursor over the rectangle, from left to right, each slice expanded to cover the rest of the image, exposing a complete photograph underneath, all of which were placed in the center of the screen against a larger black background rectangle encasing the portfolio image. The page title and contact remain on the page, but titles announcing the name and year for the project are listed on the bottom left corner of the project, sometimes directly below and sometimes 1" below, in 12 pt black typeface, project name in all capital letters but none of the text is emphasized in bold or italics. The only bold on the page is Mr. Andersen's name and career desingations in the headline.<br>Although there are dates on the projects, they are not in chronological order, which gave me a sense of appreciation for breaking with tradition, and confusion over how the author had decided to lay out his timeline. Was he grouping things in the order he was most proud of? Would I ever be able to figure that out? I ran from left to right, then right to left, but never found the answer to that question. Then I decided perhaps the only hierarchy of the images came from the visual balance they created when being sliced up and put back together to form the hero image and focal point of the site (the introductory rectangle comprised of photographic slices). I tried to scroll down or explore further but there was nothing.</p><br>

		<h2><strong><em>Question 2: What makes these sites similar or different?</strong></em></h2>

		<p>In comparing the two sites, I was struck by the minimalist details of both, the clean beautiful lines and striking visual contrasts of light and dark, black and white that created a strong visual balance and flow. The predominate use of rectangles in various forms on both sites, as both backrounds and photographic shapes, also helped establish consistency in the flow and balance of both sites. Additionally, the single page site for Mr. Andersen made a solid, concise statement and a strong impact for his more limited portfolio. I am amazed that, although both sites have a similar color palette, Mr. Andersen's use of color created a solemness that reflected the serious tone of his works. I did feel, however, that this is somewhat in contrast with the actual work he displays. That said, he is very intentional geometric in his design and that does reflect clearly in both the focal point and the subsequent photographs of his work. I also appreciate that his content opened in pop-ups onto the screen, keeping navigation and flow straightforward and simple for anyone to determine. That said, the out of order timeline of the site's work was a bit confusing and something I would pay closer attention to if I were going to use dates on my own site. Also, although Mr. Andersen's site was concise and clear, Mr. Duval's site used the same palette to relay a strong, creative representation of his work that reflected the same level of fun and exploration that his photographs possess. It was a solid feast for the eyes that keeps the viewer engaged in the content and hierarchy of the pages without creating any sense of confusion. Definintely something I am keeping in mind as I design my own site.</p>



<h2>Step 4 and 5: Lindsey's Thumbnail Sketches for Artist Portfolio Site</h2>

<p>This is a very rough depiction of how I see the site. The thumbnails are listed in the same order that the pages will be displayed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail Image 1</strong><img src="Thumbnail1.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image 1">Thumbnails A and A1 are both renderings of the index page of the site. In thumbnail A, the headline contains the name of the artist and the type of work that can be expected on the website. The primary focal point is a photograph (from the body of work) that serves as a solid introduction to the series to come. Clicking this photo would dissolve the site into the 2nd page. The photograph is located in the center of what could be considered a 3 grid column.<br>A1 is a second rendering that only contains the name of the artist without announcing the site type (photography/filmography). It features the same concept of an introductory image as the focal point, but in an ode to Duval, this would fade away on its own and automatically take viewers to B and B1</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail Images 2 and 3</strong><img src="Thumbnail2.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image 2"><img src="Thumbnail3.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image 3">Thumbnails B and B1 are renderings of the second site page. In the left hand B, the focal point is a selection of either Photography or Filmography, with the artist's name above them. In the 2nd option, B on the right side contains a 2 column grid with rectangular photographs that would change when the cursor is rolled over them. The site has a strong visual balance. Clicking on the photographs would open the 3rd site page. The line below contains a 3rd and 4th option for the site. One consists of only the selections Photography and Filmography with no artist name. The other is also in a two column grid formation where the titles and images are listed top to bottom so as not to confuse the reader.</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail Image 4</strong> <img src="Thumbnail4.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image 4">Thumbnail 4 is one representation of what will happen when the "photography" title is selected. It got too wordy and I abandoned it. Thumbnail B3 located next to it is another sketch of how the photograph/filmography page can be rendered. Also in column form, but with the image corners touching and the titles underlined.</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail Image 5</strong><img src="Thumbnail5.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image 5"> Thumbnail 5 depicts what the Filmography page will look like when opened. The title is off to the top left of the screen. The primary focal point is the movie poster in the center of the page and a text description. It primary consistes of 3 columns with the column on the farthest left negative space. There is also the option of a navigation bar to cue the viewers to look below the fold. On the right side thumbnail sketch is another rendering for how the photography page will appear when opened. Like the Duval side, I opted for rectanglar photographs that have been paired on the same invisible line. When the cursor moves over each one, it reveals part of the set of images that can be found if the picture is clicked. Below these images in a brief summary of the photography set.</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail Image 6</strong><img src="Thumbnail6.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image 6">Thumbnail 6, labeled C2, depicts the continuation of the filmography site, specifically what viewers will see when they scroll below the fold. The images are centered on the page, with a brief introduction written off to the right side. The page is split into 3 columns with the farthest one on the left negative space. There is a possibility that each photograph of the movie poster will change to reveal an entire set of images from the film when the cursor moves over. I am still considering this. Thumbnail C3 is the next page in the photography site. Depending which image the viewer selects, a new page will open with the title of the set, a brief tone-setting description and a series of rectangular images listed from top to bottom on the page. All of the text and pictures would be centered down the page to create balance.  Altneratively, Thumbnail C4 shows the same concept as C3, but reformatted so that the title is centered on the page and the writing streches from the left to the right page border. The first photographic image is centered below this text and surrounded with an equal amount of space on the right and left side of the screen.</li>
		<br>
		<li><strong>Thumbnail Image 7</strong><img src="Thumbnail7.jpg" alt="Thumbnail Image 7">Thumbnail 7 depicts 2 versions of the "About" page. I think I will reference that on the index page of the site but I am not sure quite where as yet. In the left sketch the artist's photograph and bio would be centered on the page as the focal, most likely black text on a white background. An even amount of negative space would hold the text and image on the right and left side of the page. The right sketch is an alternative view that places the artist's photograph at the top, left section of the page with text stretching from left to write, filling the page and leaving a small border of white space on the left and right sides.</li>
